# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of binary trees and related concepts, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and max binary heaps. We will implement various functions to create, manipulate, and traverse binary trees. The goal is to understand the structure and operations associated with binary trees.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a binary tree is and its characteristics.
- Differentiate between binary trees and binary search trees.
- Explore traversal methods for binary trees.
- Define terms like depth, height, size, and balance for binary trees.
- Implement functions to create, insert, and delete nodes in binary trees.
- Learn about complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## File Structure

- `binary_tree_print.c`: Visualization function for binary trees (provided for visualization purposes).
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a binary tree node.
- `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`: Function to insert a node as the left-child of another node.
- `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`: Function to insert a node as the right-child of another node.
- `3-binary_tree_delete.c`: Function to delete an entire binary tree.
- `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`: Function to check if a node is a leaf.
- `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`: Function to check if a given node is a root.
- `6-binary_tree_preorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
- `7-binary_tree_inorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using in-order traversal.
- `8-binary_tree_postorder.c`: Function to traverse a binary tree using post-order traversal.
- `9-binary_tree_height.c`: Function to measure the height of a binary tree.
- `10-binary_tree_depth.c`: Function to measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.
- `11-binary_tree_size.c`: Function to measure the size of a binary tree.
- `12-binary_tree_leaves.c`: Function to count the leaves in a binary tree.
- `13-binary_tree_nodes.c`: Function to count the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
- `14-binary_tree_balance.c`: Function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.
- `15-binary_tree_is_full.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is full.
- `16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: Function to check if a binary tree is perfect.
- `17-binary_tree_sibling.c`: Function to find the sibling of a node in a binary tree.
- `18-binary_tree_uncle.c`: Function to find the uncle of a node in a binary tree.
- `README.md`: Project README file (you are currently reading this).

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Use the standard library.
- Prototypes of all functions in `binary_trees.h`.
- Header files should have include guards.

## Usage

You can use the provided `binary_tree_print.c` file to visualize the binary trees you create. The main files (e.g., `0-main.c`, `1-main.c`, etc.) can be used as examples to test your functions.
